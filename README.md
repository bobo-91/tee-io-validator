# TEE-IO Device Validation Utility

Intel TDX Connect adds “device” to TEE scope. “Device” need to follow standard protocols (SPDM, IDE, TDISP) to communicate with Intel Root Port and Intel TDX TSM. We need validate the interoperability between the device and Intel component.

**TEE-IO Device Validation Utility** is proposed to validate the interoperability of standard protocols (SPDM/IDE/TDISP) between the device and Intel component.
